*To the point:* The developmental and adult responses to copper stress is not strongly phenotypically correlated, but does share some overlap of QTL associated with each trait. The genetic factors that contribute to copper resistance are therefore likely life stage-specific.

*A little more detail:* I measured developmental delay and developmental viability in 100 DSPR strains in response to copper stress (exposed to 2mM Copper(II) Sulfate throughout development). The effect of copper on development was generally negative but was also highly variable across the 100 DSPR strains. In organisms with complex life cycles, trait responses are often decoupled such that for a given genotype, individuals who are resistant to a stress or stimulus as adults may be highly susceptible as larvae. I tested for evidence of decoupling by correlating the developmental responses with adult survival. The relationship was not significant, suggesting that copper resistance in developmental stages is not predictive of adult resistance (and vice versa). I used QTL mapping to identify regions of the genome that may influence developmental response to copper and identified one QTL near the gene mekk1, which has been previously linked to response to cadmium. This QTL overlapped with one of the QTL associated with adult copper resistance, and alleles present at this region had correlated estimated effects on copper resistance across life stages. Collectively, my results suggest that there is evidence of some shared genetic architecture for copper resistance across life stages, although this one site does not completely explain variation in the developmental response to copper. I am currently measuring developmental viability in the remaining DSPR strains to more rigorously address these questions and vet these findings.
