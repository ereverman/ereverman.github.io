*To the point:* The physiological response to copper stress is a genetically complex trait that is influenced by naturally occurring allelic variation in genes responsible for metabolism, detoxification, and transport of copper and other more dangerous heavy metals including lead and cadmium.  

*A little more detail:* I used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping to identify genes with allelic variation that influence copper resistance (recently published in Genetics). This work was carried out using >1500 unique, genetically stable strains from the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR, King et al. 2012, Genetics). I measured copper resistance in adult female flies following 48 hr exposure to 50mM Copper(II) Sulfate and mapped 12 regions of the Drosophila genome (QTL) that are associated with adult copper resistance (Fig 1). These regions included hundreds of potential candidate genes, several of which are known to be involved in copper metabolism. This result demonstrates that allelic variation for key copper metabolism genes exists in natural populations despite the delicate balance required for proper copper homeostasis. I narrowed down genes implicated by QTL for functional testing and demonstrated that genes involved in copper metabolism such as copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (Ccs) as well as genes involved in metabolism of other metals (Znt41F, trpl) influence the adult response to copper stress.
