Organisms experience a wide range of stressors that influence their ability to reproduce, survive, and adapt over time. Work in my lab focuses on the roles that genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and behavior play in response to anthropogenic sources of stress. We leverage the _Drosophila melanogaster_ model system through a combination of large mapping populations and wild-collected populations to determine the genetic and evolutionary factors that influence physiological and behavioral copper stress resistance. Current research areas include:

* Quantitative genetics of copper tolerance
* Evolution of resistance to heavy metals
* Physiological and behavioral plasticity
